# Delete the Pinecone index
==
Because you are running this as part of a Pinecone-hosted event and in the AWS sandbox provided to you, you do not need clean up any AWS resources. However, in order to prevent unforseen charges to your Pinecone account, we recommend deleting the Pinecone index that was created during this workshop. If you plan to use this index later, remember to clean up once you are done.

To delete the Pinecone index:
1. Navigate to the [Jupyter tab](tab-0)
2. Open the notebook in the `notebooks` folder called `4_clean_up.ipynb`
3. Select `Python 3 (ipykernel)` for the kernel in the upper right
4. Work through each cell in the notebook

# Wrapping up
==
In this workshop you learned:
- The fundamentals of vector databases and how to create intelligent, context-aware applications leveraging advanced techniques for semantic search and language modeling
- Understanding of the agentic RAG architecture and its applications, including information storage, retrieval and augmented text generation
- Hands-on experience with Pinecone's state-of-the-art vector database and AWS services for building and deploying AI solutions
- Best practices for integrating Pinecone and AWS services to create robust and scalable AI workflows

# Extra resources
